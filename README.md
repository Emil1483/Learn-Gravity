# Learn Gravity

This app is made me, a private individual, as part of my portfolio. If you are looking for a flutter developer (developer for both iOS and android), please send me an email at emil14833@gmail.com.

“Learn Gravity” is a fun sandbox experience to familiarize yourself with the concept of gravity. It begins with an article explaining gravity. Then, you will answer a test-yourself quiz to unlock the sandbox.

This app is also avalable at the google play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.djupvik.grav_sim)
