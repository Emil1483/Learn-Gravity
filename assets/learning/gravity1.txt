Gravity is a an universal force between any two objects. And that is ANY two objects.
That means that there is a force between me and you this very second, albeit a very
weak force. Moreover, above, two objects orbit each other due to gravity. See how
their gravitational forces are equal in magnitude? Think about what that means. It
means that I pull on the earth as much as the earth is pulling on me.
